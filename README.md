## Todo:

1.  Create Auth Context and in that store user details in localStorage and only fetch user data when ever the username changes this will resolve the issue of data retention in dashboard page.

2.  Also after the user is changing the profile and navigates to another page midway then just rest the changes or make sure to display a dialogue box and inform the user and ask for confirmation.

3.  After this check ways to improve navigation speed.

4.  Create a Web Socket connection with the users and the creators so that the payments donated are shared in real time!

5.  Deploy it on Vercel and make sure to use vercel queues in case the database operations are intense and due to cold start the server starts very slowly.

6. Create a feature in which the creators can see all the analytics relevant to them.

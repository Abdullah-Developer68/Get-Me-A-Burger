// These are Next.js file-level exports (evaluated at build/run time), not
// CommonJS `exports`. They tell Next.js how to run this route:
// - `runtime = "nodejs"` runs the handler in a Node.js server runtime (needed
//   by some parts of the Stripe SDK and for reliable raw-body handling).
// - `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` disables static generation/caching so this
//   route executes fresh on every request (required for real-time webhook
//   processing and exact signature verification).

// This is different from dynamic routing. This is dynamic rendering this specifically applies to the rendering behavior of the route,
// ensuring that it always runs on the server and never gets cached.

// On the other hand dynamic routing is this [...Stripe]/route.js this allows to create URL parameters.

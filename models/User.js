// Prevent model recompilation in dev / hot-reload. This is mainly an issue in Next.js
// but not in express.js because in express server starts once and keeps running so models
//  are created only once. In Next.js, whenever and api route is called or during hot reload
//  the next.jg might recall that file. This means the line `mongoose.model("User", schema)` might
//  run again in the same process. So this says the user model already exists in mongoose then do not overwrite it.

const User = models.User || model("User", userSchema);

export default User;
// in express it would be -> module.exports = User;
